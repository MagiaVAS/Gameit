## preamble

*Gameit* is an intelligent gamification framework that accepts a set of predefined `rules` and uses a structured and high level abstracted language to generates the respective functions in Python-3.


## How it works?

*Gameit* uses rules for constructing the functions, but what are rules? every rule is contain a set of conditions and is defined by a logical relation between these conditions.

Conditions, in other hand are combination of attributes and operations which define a particular behavior of an entity.


In order to get the *Gameit* to works, you need to define three separate files so that it can use them for generating the functions. These three files are:

   - Methods
   - Awards
   - Rules
